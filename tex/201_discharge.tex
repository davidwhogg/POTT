\textbf{Problem 201}

A car battery stores a lot of energy!
A typical car battery has a capacity of $50\,\A\,\h$ (amp-hours) at $12\,\V$.

A really stupid thing to do is to short out a car battery with a copper wire!
(Don't try this at home.)
Imagine you short out a car battery like this with a copper wire that has a
length of, say, $0.5\,\m$ and a diameter of, say, $5\,\mm$.
Questions, from easy to hard:

\textsl{(a)}~How much energy is released by this short-out?
\textsl{Extra credit:} Convert your answer into TNT-equivalent-mass units.

\textsl{(b)}~If the resistivity of copper is $1.7\times 10^{-8}\,\ohm\,\m$, how
long does the battery take to discharge? Your simple answer is wrong here, because of
course the battery itself has an internal impedance. What do you think is a good
setting for the internal impedance of a car battery and why?

\textsl{(c)}~If copper contains something like one free electron per atom
(we here at POTT headquarters have no idea if this is true), how far
does a typical electron move along the copper wire
during the process of fully shorting out this battery?
