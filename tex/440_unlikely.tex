\textbf{Problem 410}

Many things are possible (if very unlikely) in quantum mechanics that
are impossible classically (tunneling through a potential energy
barrier, for instance).

\textsl{(1)}~Is there anything that is completely \emph{impossible} in
quantum mechanics? 

\textsl{(2)}~Of the processes that are \emph{not} impossible---and for
which you can calculate (or estimate) the probability---which one can
you think of that has the lowest probability?

\textsl{(3)} Do extremely small probabilities have any meaning? If
not, what is the smallest probability that we can assign meaning to?
Does this change your answer to part \textsl{(1)}?
