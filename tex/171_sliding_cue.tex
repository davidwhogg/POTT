\textbf{Problem 171}

\textsl{(a)}~Immediately after being hit, at $t=0$, a cue ball of mass
$M$ and radius $R$ slides along the pool-table felt at speed $v_i$, not rotating
at all.  As time goes on, the ball slows down (because of friction)
and, at the same time, starts to spin.  Draw a free-body diagram for
the cue ball.

\textsl{(b)}~At what time $t_\mathrm{r}$ does the ball get to the
situation of ``rolling without slipping''?  Assume that there is a
coefficient $\mu$ of sliding friction. You will have to look up (or
compute) the moment of inertia $I$ for a uniform sphere.

\textsl{(c)}~Plot $v(t)$ and $R\,\omega(t)$ vs $t$ on a single plot.
\emph{Note that the two things have the same
dimensions.}  Clearly label $t_\mathrm{r}$ on your diagram with a
line.
Interpret all the polygonal areas you can identify on that plot.

\textsl{(d)}~In the long run, the cue ball will stop rolling. Explain
why or how. \emph{Note that there are many qualitatively different
answers for a problem that contains the words ``explain why''.
Provide as many as you can.}
