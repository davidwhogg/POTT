\textbf{Problem 202}

Electricity and magnetism are closely intertwined with special relativity.

Imagine that you have a very long straight wire that is electrically
neutral and carrying a
current $I$. Now boost into a new frame moving along that wire at some speed $v$.
Why is the wire \emph{not} electrically neutral in the boosted frame?

What do you have to assume about the wire in order to calculate the net
electrical charge per unit length on the wire in the boosted frame?
Use symmetry arguments here if you like!

Now imagine you have a neutral wire carrying no current, and you are in the
rest frame of that wire. If you attach a battery and current starts to flow,
does the wire have to become charged? After all, you will not be in the rest
frame of both the wire and the moving charge inside the wire.
Or can this special-relativity-enforced
charging of the wire be avoided somehow? Or is this question somehow ill-posed?
