\textbf{Problem 105}

A gondola in the Alps carries 20 people across a gorge.
It hangs from a tense steel cable stretched tightly across the gorge.
At the point of contact, the weight of the gondola (including especially
the people, which dominate the mass) causes the cable to bend slightly;
that is, there is an angle between the cable ahead of the gondola and the
cable behind the gondola.

\textsl{(a)}
If the cable bends by 4 degrees at this point of contact,
approximately what is the tension $T$ in the cable?

\textsl{(b)}
If the cable is $2\,\cm$ thick and made of steel, approximately what is the
transverse wave speed in that cable for long-wavelength waves?

\textsl{(c)}
The gondola cables are anchored at anchor points on the mountain ridges on each
side of the gorge. What do you think those anchor points look like?
