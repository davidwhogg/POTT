\textbf{Problem 901}

Your twin sibling works in long-distance air cargo.
On your joint 20th birthday, your sibling began 
flying around in airplanes at high altitudes for most of every week.
Your joint 30th birthday approaches.
When you meet up for your 30th birthday, who will have aged more, and
by how much (in, say, microseconds)?

There are both time-dilation and gravitational-redshift considerations
here; which is dominant, and which has which sign?
Can you argue which one is dominant on general principles,
without actually calculating anything about altitudes or velocities?
