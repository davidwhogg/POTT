\textbf{Problem 901}

Your twin sibling works in long-distance air cargo.
On your joint 20th birthday, your sibling began 
flying around in airplanes at high altitudes for most of every week.
You, on the other hand, are lazy and almost never leave your sea-level apartment.
Your joint 30th birthday approaches.
When you meet up for your 30th birthday, who will have aged more, and
by how much (in, say, microseconds)?

There are both time-dilation and gravitational-redshift considerations here;
which is dominant, and which has which sign?
Can you argue which one is dominant on \emph{general principles},
without actually calculating anything about altitudes or velocities?
If so, do your general principles apply to the GPS satellites, which fly at
around $20\,000\,\km$?
And how do your general principles square with the general-relativity point
that there is no conceptual difference between a kinematic redshift and a
gravitational redshift?

Side question:
What other physiological differences might have accrued between your sibling
and you from your different lifestyles?
