\textbf{Problem 943}

\textsl{(a)}
Consider an L-shaped gravitational-wave antenna, like the Hanford detector
of \textsl{LIGO}.
Are there black-hole inspirals to which this antenna is completely insensitive,
even in the absence of noise?
That is, what are the inspiral events that are fundamentally and formally invisible to this
detector?
Assume that the event is far, far shorter than one day, so Earth rotation can be ignored.
\emph{Note: You don't need to know any General Relativity in order to answer this question; use symmetries!}

\textsl{(b)}
Are your answers still valid if the black holes have spin?
What spin directions can the black holes have that will invalidate
or keep valid your answer to part (a)?

\textsl{(c)}
Now let the Earth rotate through a finite angle during the event.
Are there still formally invisible events?

\textsl{(d)}
Now generalize this question to electromagnetism, where the source is a 
spinning electrical dipole, and the antenna is a straight quarter-wave antenna.
