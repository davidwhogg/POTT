\textbf{Problem 125}

\textsl{(a)}
It is possible to sail into the wind, not directly, but at an angle.
Convince yourself---by considering pressure forces on the sail and
the keel---that sailing upwind is only possible because of the angle
between the sail and the keel. If it helps to simplify the problem,
consider only a flat sail and flat keel; that is, ignore the curvature
of the sail.

\textsl{(b)}
Now consider a sailboat sitting on a long, wide, straight river
that is flowing at a steady current of $0.5\,\mps$ on a
windless day. That is, there is no wind \emph{with respect to the riverbank}.
If the sailboat wants to go downstream, can it
travel any faster downstream than $0.5\,\mps$ by raising its sails
and sailing?

\textsl{(c)}
Is there any way that a boat, powered only by the wind, can
make steady progress \emph{upstream} on this slow-moving river on
this windless day?

{\normalsize\emph{Based on a question from Matt Kleban.}}
