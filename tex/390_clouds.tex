\textbf{Problem 390}

Observe the clouds on a partly cloudy day.
Note that the clouds neither systematically expand nor contract.
The clouds neither systematically fall nor rise.
Look carefully and you can see clouds condensing and evaporating in real time.

What do these observations mean?
They mean that the clouds are at the same \emph{pressure} as the surrounding air.
They mean that the clouds have the same \emph{density} as the surrounding air.
And they mean that the clouds have (more or less) the same \emph{composition} as the surrounding air.

So what gives? What's different about a cloud from the air around it?
