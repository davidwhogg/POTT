\textbf{Problem 280}

When you look in a wall-mounted mirror, your reflected image (is it a
real image or a virtual image?) has right and left swapped, relative
to you. But not top and bottom. Does it have front and back swapped?

There is a sense in which the left and right swap of the mirror has a
different character than the front and back swap. What is that sense?
Be as specific or definite as you can be.

It might help to think of standing on a mirror that is lying flat on
the ground. Your reflection in that horizontal mirror has top and
bottom flipped, but left and right also.
