\textbf{Problem 210}

When electricity is delivered over very long distances, it is
transmitted in ``high tension power lines'' at very high voltage.

\textsl{(a)} Why do you think it is better to transmit at high
voltage than low voltage when you are delivering power over very
long distances?

\textsl{(b)} If it is good to go to high voltage, what sets the
voltage? Why not go to infinite voltage? One consideration might be
the dielectric break-down strength of air: If air breaks down at
electric-field strengths of a few million V/m, does that put a
constraint on anything? Since the units are not voltage but
electric-field strength, what, exactly, does it constrain?
(\emph{Hint:} It isn't the distance of the wire from the ground!)

\textsl{(c)} Long-distance power-transmission lines are often
described as ``high tension''. Is there anything about the
\emph{tension} of the power lines that might matter? Or is this
just an alternative use of the word ``tension'' to mean ``voltage''?
