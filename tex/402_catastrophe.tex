\textbf{Problem 160}

The ultraviolet catastrophe is one of the classic paradoxes that
pointed towards quantum mechanics.  It is often said that the
quantization of the electromagnetic field resolves the paradox.

Consider a rectilinear cavity with perfectly conducting walls.  In the
classical theory, the boundary condition quantizes the modes of the
electromagnetic field in units of the inverse size of the cavity, but
there is still an ultraviolet catastrophe, because the number of modes
is infinite. What additional quantization for the modes does quantum
mechanics introduce that resolves the paradox? And what was the problem,
classically, with having an infinite number of modes?
