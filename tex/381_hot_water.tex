\textbf{Problem 381}

In preparation for the hot NYC summer, imagine (very realistically!)
that the temperature outside is 100\,F while you cannot tolerate more
than 80\,F in your room. Unfortunately, you have no access to
electrical energy (we are all lucky that this is a less realistic
assumption for us). Of course, you could cool down your room if you
had access to running water at the temperature below 80\,F. Can you
do it using hot water, say at 200\,F? Can you do it using lukewarm
water at 90\,F?
