\textbf{Problem 266}

Imagine a conducting (finite conductivity) uniformly dense infinitely
long neutral wire with uniform circular cross section, coaxial with the
$z$ axis (that is, the usual).
This wire is neutral but carries a steady current $I$
in the positive $z$ direction.

The charges making up the current $I$ are
discretized.
That is, the wire contains enormous numbers of carriers, each of charge $e$
(the sign of the charge is up to you).
If we take a snapshot in time, is the distribution of
electron positions and velocities uniform in a cross-section?  Or,
better said, can you self-consistently assume that?

What \emph{can} you self-consistently assume?
