\textbf{Problem 405}

Astronomers will tell you that the angular resolution of an ideal telescope is
set by the ratio of the wavelength $\lambda$ of the light being detected
to the diameter $D$ of the telescope aperture. That is, an exceedingly distant
point source will appear (in a well-focused, optically good) telescope with
an angular size (in radians) of roughly $\lambda / D$ (ignoring lots of details
like Airy patterns and so forth).

(a) Show that this result can be seen as a direct consequence of quantum
mechanical uncertainty, or that you can't know the momentum of the photon and
the position of the photon at the same time. \textsl{Hint: The direction of
  a photon is related to its transverse momentum, and the fact that the
  photon entered the telescope is related to its transverse position. Does
  that help?}

(b) How does this all apply to the output of a laser? A laser emits a very
collimated beam of photons. But (because of uncertainty) it can't be perfectly
collimated! What properties of the laser set the angular divergence
of the output beam?
