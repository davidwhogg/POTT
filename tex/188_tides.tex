\textbf{Problem 188}

There are two high tides a day, why?

What might not have occurred to you is that the amplitude of the water
tide on the Earth is comparable to the amplitude of the rock
tide. They are both a couple meters. Sea level rises and falls because these
two tides are \emph{out of phase}.

(There are also some resonant effects that lead to very high tides in
some places, like, famously, the Bay of Fundy.)

Why are the water and rock tides out of phase? There is a simple
reason, but it is not even close to the whole story. Consider, for
example, a completely water planet, or a completely rock planet.
