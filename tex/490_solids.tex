\textbf{Problem 490}

The particles in an atomic lattice make up a vanishingly small fraction
of the total volume of the solid.
In this sense, normal materials are almost entirely ``empty space''.
Of course this is misleading:
When you put a mug down on a table, the mug doesn't pass through the table!
What causes the repulsion that keeps the mug and table from inter-penetrating?

\textsl{(a)} Many people think that the repulsion is classical electrostatic repulsion.
Is this possible?
Think about two incommensurate electrostatic crystals made up of $+e$ and $-e$ charges
in two rigid, globally neutral lattices.
Show (at any level of rigor you like) that these two crystals will in fact \emph{attract}
one another, not repel, and they will have lowest energy when fully inter-penetrated.

\textsl{(b)} Show that making the crystals non-rigid makes this
problem even worse!

\textsl{(c)} If all this is true, what makes solids repel one another when they come into contact?

\textsl{(d)} Historically, did Maxwell and contemporaries understand this argument?
\textit{Maybe that's a question for the internet, not the toilet!}
