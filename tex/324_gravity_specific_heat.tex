\textbf{Problem 324}

Consider a near-ideal gas of light particles gravitationally bound to a massive body.

\textsl{(1)}~Is the specific heat positive or negative?
That is, if you add energy to the system, does the effective temperature of the gas go up or down?

\textsl{Hint:} There is a \emph{virial theorem} that says if the potential energy goes like $1/r$, then the mean kinetic energy of the particles in the potential will be negative 1/2 times the mean potential energy (referenced to infinity). It's an impressive and weird theorem.

\textsl{(2)}~Can this system be in thermal equilibrium?

\textsl{(3)}~If it cannot, what will be the time evolution?
What kinds of things do you need to know about the particles to predict that time evolution in detail?
