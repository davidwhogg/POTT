\textbf{Problem 971}

Hydrogen atoms have a transition corresponding to a photon wavelength of $0.21\,\m$ (the 21-cm line).
This transition is extremely important for observational astrophysics.
The wavelength is far, far larger than the size of the atom.
What implications---if any---does this immense length ratio
have for the transition, including rate, line-width, and so on?
